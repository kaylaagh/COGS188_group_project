    "# Abstract \n",
    "This project aims to build an AI model that solves the game Minesweeper using reinforcement learning algorithms. Minesweeper is a logic based game where the goal is to uncover all non-mine cells while avoiding mines. The game environment is a grid where each cell can either contain a mine or be safe. The numbers on the revealed cells tell you the number of adjacent mines. If you accidentally uncover the mine cell, then the game will end. The dataset is generated from a Python-based Minesweeper implementation, consisting of game states, player actions, and board configurations.\n",
    "The mindsweeper solver will operate as a rational agent by optimizing its performance uncovering safe cells, in the stochastic environment. We will be using search algorithms and heuristic strategies to effectively solve the problem. To evaluate performance, we will use win rate and average game duration as key metrics."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Minesweeper is a single-player game where players must uncover all safe tiles without clicking on a mine! Safe squares provide numerical clues indicating how many mines are within a one-tile radius. The game features three official board sizes: Beginner (8×8 grid with 10 mines), Intermediate (16×16 grid with 40 mines), and Expert (16×30 grid with 90 mines). Clicking on a mine ends the game immediately, while selecting a safe tile may reveal numbers or automatically clear nearby squares. The challenge relies on using logic while simultaneously minimizing the risk of guessing. To win, all non-mine squares must be uncovered, leaving only the mines flagged.\n",
    "<br> <br>\n",
    "According to Kaye, “the Minesweeper problem is NP-Complete”, meaning that it is highly unlikely that there is an efficient algorithm that can solve it and that it is just as difficult as any other NP-Complete problem (like the traveling salesman problem)[1]. In other words, there is no known algorithm that can solve Minesweeper in polynomial time. Despite that some parts of the board can be determined through logical reasoning, some configurations require probabilistic guessing, making Minesweeper a constraint satisfaction problem[2].\n",
    "<br> <br>\n",
    "Given these papers, reinforcement learning will be explored in this project. There exists research, where Monte Carlo Simulation was used to solve the Minesweeper problem[3]. Another study showed that a mix of optimal heuristics proved to solve the problem with more efficiency. Such heuristics included: targeting the corners of the grid based on a previous study[2] due to the fact that the density of a mine in a corner is lower than any other tiles, maximizing the probability of revealing at least one safe-block in one move, and maximizing the expected number of safe blocks in the next move[4]. This greedy heuristic algorithm was named PSEQ. In a different study, double deep-Q-network was applied to the problem[5]. For this project, we will focus on implementing the Q-learning algorithm and additional heuristic(s)."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Mindsweeper is a puzzle game where it requires players to uncover safe cells while avoiding the mine cells using the adjacent numerical clues. The goal of the game is to uncover the whole entire board without touching a mine. This game requires different strategies and sometimes risk taking when you run out of clues. You have to be able to make the most optimal decision within the stochastic environment where you don’t know where the mines are. The problem we are addressing is developing an AI-based Minesweeper solver that will be the most efficient when in play, using search algorithms and heuristic strategies. This problem is quantifiable since we are able to perform probability calculations and logical inference. It is also measurable since we can calculate the performance based on win rates and average game durations. Lastly, it is replicable since each time you play it is a different game board, allowing us to consistently use our algorithm since the rules do not change.\n"

    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this project will be generated using a Pygame-based Minesweeper implementation (https://pypi.org/project/pygame-minesweeper/ ). The dataset consists of game states, score ranking, and the final outcome, whether a win or loss. This implementation has various board configurations, such as Basic (10x10 grid with 10 mines), Intermediate (16x16 grid with 40 mines), Expert (6x30 grid with 99 mines), and Custom (users can define the number of rows, columns, and mines). Each board state is represented as a 2D grid where cells can be hidden. They can be revealed with a number indicating the count of adjacent mines, or flagged as a potential mine by the solver. The data collection process involves the solver interacting with the Minesweeper game by tracking wins or loses.\n"
